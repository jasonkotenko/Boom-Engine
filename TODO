Boom Engine ToDo List
---------------------
So much to do...

- Per-poly collision detection
	- Do we need this or can we abstract the level into a grid somehow?
	- How to handle characters and objects?
- Mount compressed archives through the virtual filesystem
	- Finish listdir for bzipped archives
	- Finish exists for bzipped archives
	- Should we allow other compression methods? gzipped tar? zip?
- Add and test simple pickups
	- Make them from files?
		- Should bombs be here too? Multiple bomb types?
- Menu system
	- Handle submenus
